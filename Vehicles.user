  <thing id="vehSkates" name="Wächter Sunrise Talrico Skates" description="Anyone who’s seen the neighborhood kids flit around as if running on twenty centimeters of thin air has seen the Talarico skates in action. Careful observation reveals that these skates are not being used by adults. We may conclude, then, that either (1) adults are too smart to use them, or (2) the children who use them do not survive to become adults. \n\nTalarico skates can more than double the running speed of a typical biped, but they require signifcant skill to use safely. They’re not available in sizes suitable for anything much larger than an adult human, which means that neophants on skates are not among the many mobile catastrophes this universe will throw at you. Unless, of course, your GC invents some neophants with high jury-rigging skills." compset="Vehicle">

  <thing id="vehScooter" name="Jogamoto fleetworks “Ninjurai 47” Scooter" description="Numerous consumer manufacturers produce personal scooters. The Ninjurai 47 was created by Jogamoto, a subsidiary of Gaines-Uashjo. It’s designed for comfortable errand-running, not combat. The open-air design offers zero protection from incoming fre and the “quiet” propulsor turbines are too loud for stealth. The Ninjurai’s prevalence on battlefelds is likely due to its low cost, which makes it very nearly disposable and therefore extremely attractive to quartermasters focused on the bottom line. It is available in either Ground, Air, or Water models.\n\nHeavily armored soldiers looking for zippy, stylish transit through a theater of operations can cruise along at 25m/sec, secure in the knowledge that when they come under fire they’ll almost certainly live longer than their scooter. They might even recover from their scooter’s destruction quickly and adroitly enough to return fire. They might also get hit by flaming bits of their scooter, but field reports suggest this causes superficial bruising at worst." compset="Vehicle">

  <thing id="vehHvrChr" name="Wächter Com Hub Hover Chair" description="The Wächter Com Hub Hover Chair was specifcally designed for polyflorian sophonts who are dependent on vehicles for their transportation. Sophonts who are larger or smaller than the average polyflorian can use the chair, but it is likely to be uncomfortable for them. The chair has the necessary attachments and leads to allow a polyflorian to interface directly with the chair so that the chair becomes more like an extension of the polyflorian’s body than a vehicle. Com Hub chairs come with large carrying compartments and two slots suitable for attaching tools and/or mechanical arms. Debates continue whether Wächter deliberately designed these tool slots to function as weapon emplacement spots , but that is what they do." compset="Vehicle">

  <thing id="vehBblCar" name="Jogamoto Skyfleet Bubblecar" description="The skylanes of a great many metropolises teem with teardrop-shaped vehicles, most of which are owned and operated by rental and rideshare companies. Jogamoto’s Skyfleet line of bubble cars serves as a solid representative example.\n\nOften the best camouflage for urban operations is to hail a Jogamoto and tell it where to take you. The majority of the bubblecars in service will comfortably seat two medium-sized sophonts of the majority population, along with all their gear, provided they’re willing to hold that gear in their lap. Suited up in a big armor suit, a single soldier can squeeze into a bubblecar. Neophants and ursumari may need to wait a little longer for a suitable vehicle.\n\nMetropolitan traffic control is understandably restrictive, so bubblecars are always piloted by the onboard AI, with just enough personality to be polite, and to safely and speedily deliver passengers to their stated destinations. Complex instructions like “follow that car” or “lose our tail” will not confuse Jogamoto bubblecar brains, but if actual combat begins, then the vehicle will ignore any useful commands other than “take us down and find cover.”\n\nIn some locations, bubblecar brains converse freely with law enforcement departments. Committing a crime in, or from, a fleet-operated bubblecar is the sort of thing that becomes career-limiting move for the average criminal, since the car would swiftly haul them to the nearest police depot." compset="Vehicle">

  <thing id="vehDevVan" name="Jogamoto Skyfleet Delivery Vans" description="The civilian population looks at delivery vans and imagines that they are filled with durable goods, tasty treats, or perhaps smelly police detectives staring vacuously at espionage gear. They rarely consider that an unassuming Jogamoto van built to haul six tons of compressed snack cakes might, in fact, be carrying three tons of mercenaries sitting atop 600 kilos of extra-compressed snack cakes.\n\nLike the bubblecars of the Skyfleet line, Jogamoto vans do not have armor, and they are not designed to set airspeed records. They do, however, feature heavy-duty capstacks and redundant propulsor turbines, giving an unloaded van a slightly higher top speed and operating range than a car. The majority of these noisy, flying trucks are completely autonomous, owned and operated by shipping companies or snack food companies. A few are independently operated by plucky drivers, who eke out a living by making deliveries, and these entrepreneurial souls can often be hired for an unscheduled delivery of armored hurt and smashed desserts." compset="Vehicle">

  <thing id="vehWMV" name="Döblitz WMV" description="Seen by some as the delivery van at the “other end” of commerce, garbage trucks are found in nearly all metros, including those with infrastructure that allows businesses to recycle waste via a chute. Garbage trucks may run regular routes, or they may make scheduled pickups for things that won’t fit down the chute — occasionally, this includes things that the scheduling party does not want to show up on an audit of their chute-drops.\n\nThe Döblitz Foundry WMV (short for “waste management vehicle”) is the top-shelf entry in this field. Their portable compactors require quite a bit of power, so the WMV has several banks of capstacks, and the heavy-duty bin presents the equivalent of armored cover to anyone hiding behind it. For this reason, the WMV is quite popular with companies engaging in non-stealthy, urban wet-work. The WMV carries three human-sized sophonts up front, with room for four more to ride on the outside, holding handles. Of the civilian vehicles, this one is the easiest to hack for aggressive work." compset="Vehicle">
