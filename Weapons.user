  <thing id="wprGlDag" name="Blattco Ni-972 “Glass Dagger”" description="Blattco Arms made its frst foray into the beam weapon market only recently, but its effort has met with favorable critical response as well as panicked cries from those illuminated downrange.\n\nThe Ni-972 “Glass Dagger” is a long-barreled pistol with a capstack magazine in the grip. Like most Blattco weapons, it caters to those who want the frst shot to count. It fires a powerful pulse of coherent light that delivers enough heat to burn through most brands of light armor, excepting those specifcally designed to dissipate or reﬂect high temperature attacks.\n\nThis hot pulse comes at a price, however. TeNi-972 cannot be burst-fired, nor can it deliver a continuous, sweeping beam. The weapon also heats up quickly and only gets six shots out of each magazine. An extended capstack is available, upping the shot count to fifteen and allowing the wielder to ignore the first reload required in each combat. In Planet Mercenary RPG, it has the Self-supplying Ammunition quality, which mimics the real-world extended\ncapstack of this weapon.\n\nUnlike other Blattco weapons, the “Glass Dagger” can be rendered inoperable during normal use. This is by design. With the toggling of a pair of switches, the Ni-972 can discharge its entire capstack at once, dealing as much damage in a single shot as it could if all six shots had struck the target individually. This “all-in mode” makes the “Glass Dagger” a Single-use weapon, destroying its optical elements. Thereafer, the pistol must be feld-stripped and re-assembled with replacement parts before it can be fred again.\n\nUsing all-in mode with the extended capstack is not recommended if you want to keep the appendage that you use to fre your pistol." compset="Ranged">

Rather than leveraging annie-power, the BH-209 uses an extremely elegant, long-proven two-stroke fusion plant. It’s much larger and heavier than most annie-powered beam weapons. The original “handles” on the first Model 209 were a system of clamps designed for affixing the weapon to a large, powered suit, or even a vehicle, but if you can hold 40 kg at full extension while the weapon spews forth white-hot death, then you’re probably interested in a simple, stock gripping option. When Strohl introduced this option, it began calling the Model 209 the “BH” 209, where “BH” stood for “big handgun.” Trope historians within the company clamored for a BFG designation instead but cooler, less profane heads prevailed. Modern customers can select one grip or two at the time they purchase.\n\nThe BH-209’s output intensity can be varied and the aperture’s magnetic profle can be altered, providing “choke.” At the lowest intensity and with the choke set to scatter, the BH-209 can give everybody in the room a nice sunburn. Dial it up a bit and the burns climb in degree, and if you choke the beam into something straight, then at full intensity the BH-209 can cut hullmetal.\n\nAdditionally, the BH-209’s plasma stream can be magnetically coupled to the weapon’s chassis, making the weapon itself a rocket. This setting is hidden by default because when engaged, the weapon literally drives the shooter back on a pillar of fre as if they’re holding a rocket engine. Which they basically are. Successfully “piloting” a BH-209 in “rocket” mode requires incredible physical strength, blink-fast reﬂexes, and a death wish." compset="Ranged">

  <thing id="wprShurik" name="Phubahr 75 mm Shurikannon" description="When you want to hit your target like a metric truckload of drunken ninjas, hold tight and let loose with Phubahr’s 75 mm Shurikannon. This pea-shooter launches five-packs of 7.5 cm “throwing stars” at roughly 200 meters per second, and can empty a 20-round magazine (that’s 100 shuriken) in two seconds.\n\nBut when we say “hold tight,” we mean it. The Shurikannon kicks with 8,500 newtons of force for each sharp, starry cluster of joy sent downrange. That’s almost exactly the force you experienced that one time during sparring practice when you told your sensei not to hold anything back.\n\nThere have been worse ideas in the long history of bad ideas, but most of those ideas envy the Shurikannon for how cool it looks in the moments before things become pointedly un-cool. Given the recoil on this weapon, the stresses on its barrel, and the irregularities inherent in its projectiles, not to mention the failure prone workmanship characteristic of all Phubahr weapons, “pointedly un-cool” is of course a cute understatement. If your imagination has painted an unpleasant picture here, perhaps a bit of good judgment will prevent a 75 mm Shurikannon from doing the painting for you. Or, frankly, with you." compset="Ranged">

Enter the Rotary Mag-Rail Deluxe. Each of this weapon’s five barrels is a magnetic accelerator, and the weapon is confgured to take proprietary Strohl Munitions 7 mm smart ﬂechettes. The targeting system links with each smart ﬂechette, assigning it a target and an appropriate muzzle velocity. When you start hosing down the battlefeld, these tiny slivers of death actually steer themselves toward their targets, and as long as you’re pointing the weapon in the right direction, the ﬂechettes consistently strike center-of-mass, give or take 10 cm.\n\nThis is how the rich people do it.

Good point defenses can kill them before they land, of course, because they don’t have the juice to keep up their own shield for more than a split-second.\n\nThe cannon itself is cheap.
