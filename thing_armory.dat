  <thing id="wprGlDag" name="Blattco Ni-972 “Glass Dagger”" description="Blattco Arms made its first foray into the beam weapon market only recently, but its effort has met with favorable critical response as well as panicked cries from those illuminated downrange.\n\nThe Ni-972 “Glass Dagger” is a long-barreled pistol with a capstack magazine in the grip. Like most Blattco weapons, it caters to those who want the first shot to count. It fires a powerful pulse of coherent light that delivers enough heat to burn through most brands of light armor, excepting those specifically designed to dissipate or reflect high temperature attacks.\n\nThis hot pulse comes at a price, however. TeNi-972 cannot be burst-fired, nor can it deliver a continuous, sweeping beam. The weapon also heats up quickly and only gets six shots out of each magazine. An extended capstack is available, upping the shot count to fifteen and allowing the wielder to ignore the first reload required in each combat. In Planet Mercenary RPG, it has the Self-supplying Ammunition quality, which mimics the real-world extended\ncapstack of this weapon.\n\nUnlike other Blattco weapons, the “Glass Dagger” can be rendered inoperable during normal use. This is by design. With the toggling of a pair of switches, the Ni-972 can discharge its entire capstack at once, dealing as much damage in a single shot as it could if all six shots had struck the target individually. This “all-in mode” makes the “Glass Dagger” a Single-use weapon, destroying its optical elements. Thereafter, the pistol must be field-stripped and re-assembled with replacement parts before it can be fired again.\n\nUsing all-in mode with the extended capstack is not recommended if you want to keep the appendage that you use to fire your pistol." compset="Ranged">

Those systems are among the first to fail in any complex weapon design and let’s face it: if you’re carrying the Clawhammer, then you don’t care about recoil because your first shot will start and finish the job.\n\nHang on tight, though. Any kick not redirected into cycling the action is going straight back into your wrist. If your grip is the slightest bit loose, then the Clawhammer will launch itself back from your hand and hit you in the face like a… well, like a hammer.\n\nThe large muzzle of the Clawhammer boasts a diameter that allows for a wide range of specialty and custom loads.

Most soldiers have blood-nannies that can sniff out any cancerous cells before they become a problem, which is why the Phubahr PG-55 remains popular with people who need a particle gun on the cheap, and who think their shots are up to date.\n\nThe PG-55’s second most common failure mode is the electron recapture coil at the end of the barrel. On a properly tuned, non-ionizing particle gun, the nuclei grab electrons on their way out, making them electrically neutral. This prevents beam deformation in the presence of environmental magnetism, but more importantly it prevents the weapon from becoming a non-grounded ion gun — which, as you’ll learn once you’ve read the section on ion guns, is spectacularly bad." compset="Ranged">

Rather than leveraging annie-power, the BH-209 uses an extremely elegant, long-proven two-stroke fusion plant. It’s much larger and heavier than most annie-powered beam weapons. The original “handles” on the first Model 209 were a system of clamps designed for affixing the weapon to a large, powered suit, or even a vehicle, but if you can hold 40 kg at full extension while the weapon spews forth white-hot death, then you’re probably interested in a simple, stock gripping option. When Strohl introduced this option, it began calling the Model 209 the “BH” 209, where “BH” stood for “big handgun.” Trope historians within the company clamored for a BFG designation instead but cooler, less profane heads prevailed. Modern customers can select one grip or two at the time they purchase.\n\nThe BH-209’s output intensity can be varied and the aperture’s magnetic profile can be altered, providing “choke.” At the lowest intensity and with the choke set to scatter, the BH-209 can give everybody in the room a nice sunburn. Dial it up a bit and the burns climb in degree, and if you choke the beam into something straight, then at full intensity the BH-209 can cut hullmetal.\n\nAdditionally, the BH-209’s plasma stream can be magnetically coupled to the weapon’s chassis, making the weapon itself a rocket. This setting is hidden by default because when engaged, the weapon literally drives the shooter back on a pillar of fire as if they’re holding a rocket engine. Which they basically are. Successfully “piloting” a BH-209 in “rocket” mode requires incredible physical strength, blink-fast reflexes, and a death wish." compset="Ranged">

This weapon is quite small and powered by a cue-ball-sized annie plant that weighs around 2 kg. The entire weapon weighs just under three kilos.\n\nWhen drawn and flipped from “safe” to “fire” mode, the AP-130 deploys a three-pronged array of field-modulating antennae. Pull the trigger and the area enclosed by these antennae becomes a magnetic bottle, a 30-centimeter sphere of bright fury, and a beam erupts forth from that bottle striking whatever is in the weapon’s path of fire.\n\nLike the BH-209, the AP-130 offers variable intensity and choke. It also draws atmospheric gas into the back of the magnetic bottle and consumes that gas as ammunition for each shot. This means that the weapon isn’t particularly useful in a vacuum. It can, however, be fired underwater — once per shooter, usually." compset="Ranged">

The weapon solves the problem of firing into a mixed-race crowd of targets by “intelligently” selecting to stun, immobilize, or de-motivate based on the logic programming of the onboard synthetic intelligence (SI). Be warned, however! Another option is “hold fire.” Tis can prove inconvenient.\n\nUrtheep Industries guarantees the nonlethality of every shot from the M3 Incapacitator, and the weapon’s high price is due in part to the underwriting of this guarantee. The rest of the expense is the annie-powered block of motile nanotech. The onboard SI isn’t actually that expensive, but it feels like it is, because in spite of not being truly sapient, the SI is almost always smarter than the person carrying the weapon.\n\nThose fortunate enough to get their hands on a “Tater Hack,” or to convert a genuine prepatch Tater, enjoy a truly smart gun with a voracious appetite for violence, plus a constitutional inability to bite off more than it can chew.

Given the recoil on this weapon, the stresses on its barrel, and the irregularities inherent in its projectiles, not to mention the failure prone workmanship characteristic of all Phubahr weapons, “pointedly un-cool” is of course a cute understatement.

And for most civilizations it ended there.\n\nAlong came Bryanton Faire Fabricators Autocutlery with a bad idea to make good money: they would, with actionable deliberation and insufficient testing, weaponize the chainsaw. The result was the Chainsaber line of heavy melee weapons, none of which is as effective, gram for gram, as a firearm.

The weapon is surprisingly light, and when fitted correctly it’s surprisingly difficult to kill oneself with it. Maiming oneself, though? Still easy\n\nBut let’s be honest with ourselves here. The only companies that deploy the Chainsaber Mark IX are those looking for a lot of noise and a lot of gore. When the deployment works, bully! When it doesn’t?

  <thing id="wpmThrdcle" name="Urtheep Industries Thirdacle Cable-Arms" description="Urtheep Industries got its start as an engineering supply firm. In the early days, their best-selling products were their Thirdacle brand cable-arms. These were popular with machinists, engineers, technicians, and most other tool-users because they at once offered a third hand, longer reach, and the ability to snake a limb into a tight space without getting bitten by whatever made the space its home.\n\nThe inciting incident for this item being promoted as a melee weapon is lost to myth and legend, but as the story goes some tool-user’s ship was boarded and she found herself in a fight for her life. Her expertise with the Thirdacle gave her the upper hand, and the market for weaponized cable-arms was born. Urtheep Industries pounced and the “Thirdacle” became synonymous with “stay away from that guy with the tentacle strapped to his chest; he can tear you in half with his mind.”\n\nThe Thirdacle has two available control systems. For beginners, there’s the “finger puppet” waldo control, and for those who are truly serious about having a third arm, there’s a deceptively simple-looking headband that translates thought as movement. For those who don’t favor the fashion statement of a headband, the control system can alternately be surgically implanted. It’s also possible to graft a synthetic intelligence into the Thirdacle control system. This gives the cable-arm a mind of its own, which is awesome, and amazing. It’s also very ill-advised.\n\nThirdacle brand cable-arms are available in several sizes, and the model number tells you exactly what you’re getting. The first number is the cable’s base diameter at the harness and the second number is the device’s length at full extension, both in centimeters. Thus, the CA-6-200 measures 6 cm in diameter at the harness, and 2 m long. The most popular model — at least among engineers itching for a fight — is the CA-9-1200. It weighs 80 kg including the harness, and if you’re properly braced, then it can throw a human soldier across the room in two pieces. Of course, if you’re not properly braced, then it’ll also throw you in the other direction.\n\nUrtheep Industries offers many hot-swappable tools for the business end of the CA-9-1200, including simple blades, powered blades, drug injectors, cameras, and even finger-clusters capable of wielding whatever one-handed tool you care to use. If you happen to be an engineer still interested in using the Thirdacle for actual engineering tasks, the business end can be fitted with pretty much any tool you’ve ever seen." compset="Melee">

Should you brush the Abra-Cadaver against your leg, you’ll get a brief shock — not serious, but enough to get your attention — and then the device will go inert until the reset code is tapped into the base of the wand. Those deploying Abra-Cadavers should take care to lead with the weapon, striking at the foremost portion of their opponent. Those facing Abra-Cadavers would do well to make physical contact with the person holding the baton as quickly as possible, thus neutralizing the item.\n\nLike any failsafe, this system isn’t perfect.

    compset="Armor"
    description="The Troublemaker suit from Phubar is a cost-effective way to advertise to enemies that you’re only slightly bulletproof, and for this reason it’s not popular with companies that run jobs against conventionally-armed military forces. It is, however, extremely popular with companies that run jobs against lightly-armed forces, and civilians.\n\n The Mark II is a blend of short-fiber fullerenes over a network of thin, chitin-gel plates. These plates distribute impacts but will often rupture after just one or two shots. This is why we recommend to mercs expecting to face hails of bullets that they consider something a little heavier. The same is true if you anticipate being targeted by a disciplined opponent who can hit the same spot twice in rapid succession.\n\nArmor aficionados agree that the Troublemaker suit is aptly named, since it’s best deployed by easily satisfied criminals on a budget, as well as street thugs wanting to look tough and (probably) survive the next drive-by. Like all Phubar products, the Troublemaker suit is prone to failure, but its design is simple enough that it rarely fails without first sustaining fire, and that’s why it remains a top seller.\n\nA variant of this item, the “Troublemaker Plus,” includes three key upgrades: a chitingel hood and mask; secondary external plates at the elbow, knee, shoulder, and crotch; and a “gherkin-wick” assembly that absorbs embarrassing moisture and odors. Of note: the Plus model retains the same game statistics as the original.">

Thus, when you stand back up all your ribs will still be intact.\n\n Additionally, the necktie and collars are duomorphic: with a trigger command, they sweep up and over your head, providing critical cranial protection in under a second. Users should take care to keep their trigger commands unique and confidential, as on more than one occasion the suit has inadvertently killed an owner when it deployed and they had a fork in their mouth.\n\n A suite of comm peripherals for your handbrain can be securely embedded in the tie, providing helmet communications when your helmet is up, and letting you talk into the end of your necktie when the helmet is down.">

The outermost layer is reflective (ablative) and shrugs off photon- and electron-based beam weapons long enough for the wearer to take cover. A middle layer is a thick weave of single-thread fullerenes and microfine PTU threads. This drives the price way up, but the added protection is worth it. This layer is where most bullets stop. The innermost layer is a smart set of flexible, interlocking chitingel scales. These scales help distribute the force of impacts, letting you survive extreme acceleration of up to 830 m/s² (that’s a little over 80 g, Earthlings).">
