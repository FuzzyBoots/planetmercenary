    description="If you play as the Captain, then your in-game job is to make command decisions and issue orders to the other officers. You’re a little like the Adjutant to the GC, and in that role, you rely on people skills to keep the game moving.\n\nThe Captain’s bonuses reflect both expertise and experience. Mercenary captains are more than just career soldiers with brass garnish. They’re entrepreneurs with a passion for turning professionals-at-arms into a profitable fighting force. With an emphasis on profitable. And an unwritten nod toward “legal,” because that always makes things easier.\n\n{b}Bonus Skill Ranks:{/b} +2 Economics, +2 Contracts, +2 History (Military), +2 to any 1 Combat skill; also, you’re in charge!">

    description="The Chaplain provides both moral support and a moral compass. Morale and morality! Sometimes it falls to the Chaplain to point out what horrible people the other officers could become if they follow a given path. Other times the Chaplain must bring his carbine to his shoulder and clear a path with righteous indignation!\n\nCareer Chaplains are students of history, and they’re adept at citing scriptural, historical, and cultural touchstones at just the right time. In a mercenary company, their inspirational speeches usually have pointy bits right at the very end. \n\n{b}Bonus Skill Ranks:{/b} +2 Dodge, +2 History (Religious), +2 Inspire {i}or{/i} Perform, +2 to any 1 Combat skill">

    description="The tools of 31st-century medicine are extremely powerful, but the single most useful surgical instrument is always information — specifically, information about which bits are supposed to be reconnected to which other bits, and whether a particular organ would be missed, since there’s rarely time to grow a new one.\n\nYears of schooling (or equivalent experience) qualify a Doctor for the job of making everyone else not-dead as often as possible. Sure, the Doctor sometimes hands a stretcher full of mince flambé to the Chaplain, but the very best way to prevent stretcher-flambé is to pick up something far deadlier than a scalpel, and invite the folks on the other side to call {i}their{/i} chaplain.\n\n{b}Bonus Skill Ranks:{/b} +2 Dodge, +2 Medicine, +2 Xenobiology, +2 to any 1 Combat skill">

(If the Engineer is a machine-intelligence with the right attachments, then remove the word “like” from the previous sentence.) Typically, the Engineer is tasked with fixing (or building!) things in the “materiel” category, though they may also be adept at hacking the various nonsentient “thinking” machines commonly called “computers.”\n\nMercenary Engineers don’t just sit in the quartermastery playing rear-echelon wrenchmonkey, though. They need to be right there next to the boots on deck, because the odds are pretty good that the deck will eventually give way, or that the those boots will suddenly not have their rockets attached correctly anymore. \n\n{b}Bonus Skill Ranks:{/b} +2 Chemistry, +2 Engineering, +2 Experimental Sciences {i}or{/i} Mechanic, +2 to any 1 Combat skill">
