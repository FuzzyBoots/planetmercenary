<!-- This file contains the assortment of miscellaneous gear/equipment for the game
      system. Most gear is just mundane items, but a few confer special benefits via
      scripts. There are also a few that can be used as generic entries that users can
      customize without having to add new entries via the Editor.

      The behaviors of each piece of gear are controlled via a combination of field
      values, tags, and XML attributes. A brief summary of the most important of these
      is provided below:

      "stacking" attribute: controls the behavior of multiple pieces of the gear with
          respect to merging separate pieces or always keeping them distinct
      "private" attribute: controls whether the gear is made visible to the user within
          the Editor when creating a new piece of gear as a copy of an existing thing
      "isunique" attribute: controls whether the user can only ever add a single
          instance of the thing to an actor versus adding multiple instances
      "Equipment" tags: The "Helper.CustomItem" tag indicates gear that the user can
          modify the name for
      "thing" tags: The "thing.holder" tag indicates gear that can both be held within
          other holders and can hold other gear, while the "thing.holder_top" tag
          indicates gear that can only hold other (but cannot be held); omitting both
          of these tags implies the gear can only be held by suitably flagged holders
      "UserName" field: If the "Helper.CustomItem" tag is assigned, this field
          provides the default name for the item until the user changes it

  <thing id="amArmCrack" name="Armor Crackers" description="Anyone who has ever fired a handgun at an approaching column of armored cavalry knows the futility of hurling inert ballistics at hullmetal. Even micro-grenades with their white-hot atomic annihilation payloads are largely useless against properly armored vehicles. Enter armor crackers, which compress a micro-grenade laced with Boomex into one tiny apocalyptic package. As the round impacts a target, its nano-bottles break, ripping the target’s armor apart at an atomic level." compset="Ammunition" stacking="merge">

With Boomex, you can create anything from a massive fireball for distraction purposes to a carefully-aimed shaped charge that allows you discreet entrance into a place out of which someone else was trying to keep you.

These fragments have their own oxidant — far more than they need for their own immolation — ensuring there’s enough air available to spread the fire to anything nearby.\n\nMany quartermasters will not issue burner rounds, and legend has it the 1st Maxim of Maximally Effective Mercenaries, “Pillage, then burn,” was coined as an exhortation against this type of ammunition. Legend is about half-right. The maxim predates modern burner rounds by centuries, but it was coined by humans in response to the finest available conflagratory projectiles of the era: flaming arrows." compset="Ammunition" lotsize="5" stacking="merge">

  <thing id="amCheeseCt" name="Cheesecutters" description="Tis particularly offensive de-motivator round contains fermented blocks of curdled lactates. The wax seal enclosing them is broken on impact, releasing a cloud of pungent gas that — while not rendering the enemy dead — often leaves them wishing they were dead instead. Unfortunately, Cheesecutters are only truly effective when fired at short range. Over longer ranges, the wax seal tends to ablate in the air resistance, thus dissipating the effect over a long distance and turning an effective weapon into a simple bad smell. But make sure that you are at least several feet away, or your Cheesecutter shot might affect you as well." compset="Ammunition" lotsize="6" stacking="merge">

The term “micro” is usually only applied to explosive payloads delivered via rounds up to 7 mm in diameter. Given the inherent limits of chemical energy that can be stored in a single cubic millimeter of material, the most powerful micro-grenades use “doped” charges, where the payload contains a primer of high-explosive Boomex laced with billions of fullerene nano-bottles, each containing a single ionized atom of antimatter.\n\nThis ammunition is expensive, both because it’s difficult to manufacture — even with Milspec annies — and because it’s tightly controlled." compset="Ammunition" lotsize="3" stacking="merge">

You simply program the type of life into the built-in SI, and it calculates and crafts a poison-flled syringe dart that comes out the slot on the side. Unfortunately, due to the vast array of chemicals that must be in the box, each box is only able to create a single dart.

In fact, the understated design and tastefully discreet markings on the box have caused difculties for some sophonts who carried both and didn’t inspect carefully before requesting and using darts. If you don’t need your box to be discreet, then we recommend that you mark them in bright colors. This has the added beneft of potentially being intimidating to others who see you have a clearly marked Nandap Tranquilizer Kit, thus implying that you may also have a Poison Kit somewhere nearby.\n\nAs with the Poison Kit, you program the SI with the sophont that you want to drop unconscious. The chemicals necessary to render sophonts unconscious are less complex and less expensive than those which poison. At least, this is the reason that Nandap gives for their Tranquilizer Kit having multiple uses and being so much less expensive than the poison kit. Investigative bodies have occasionally made inquiries to discover if this was true, but as yet, no investigators have returned from their visits to Nandap facillities." compset="Ammunition" lotsize="6" stacking="merge">
