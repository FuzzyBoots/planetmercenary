    isunique="yes"
    description="Dodge represents your self-preservation instinct, and your training that reinforces this instinct. This is your ability to predict incoming violence and get out of the way. The source of danger is irrelevant; whether you’re threatened by a directed attack, a passive trap, the environment, or something else, you always use Dodge to avoid injury.">

    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Heavy Weapons skill when firing heavy-class weapons. If your weapon hangs underslung, feels massive, rotates, and makes terrifying noises when it’s fired, then you’re packing a heavy weapon.

    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Long Guns skill when firing long gun-class weapons. As the weapons of choice for sharpshooters, long guns include high-powered rifles, snipers, and long-range flechette guns. If you want to perch on a building and fire shots across town with pinpoint accuracy, you’ll want some deadly serious Long Gun proficiency.">

    description="Use your Pistols skill when firing pistol-class weapons. Hold-outs, fast-draw handguns, and other ranged weapons designed to be held in a single hand (or hand-equivalent appendage) are used with this skill. Pistols are more easily concealable than many other weapons, making them an excellent choice for clandestine operations in places too civilized for slinging a carbine over a shoulder (or shoulder-equivalent joint).">

The form factor of scatterguns is like that of many carbines, but these weapons require a different kind of focus and control. Some scatterguns approach heavy weapon-levels of coverage, but they’re still optimal for close quarters combat.">

    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Stationed Weapons skill when firing stationed weapons. Any weapon that is fixed into a brace, built into a structure, mounted on a swivel, or attached to a vehicle counts as a stationed weapon. You may make any Carbine, Long Gun, Scattergun, or Heavy Weapon into a Stationed Weapon by attaching it to a preinstalled weapons slot that already exists in a vehicle, turret, tripod, or wall. If a pre-installed weapons slot is not available, you may still make your weapon stationed by rolling an Engineering check or Mechanic (Jury-rig) check TN 20. The ability to make weapons stationed is particularly valuable to small sophonts, such as esspererin.">

    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="They say “necessity is the mother of invention,” and many who said this actually survived the havoc wrought by their inventions. Some even went on to live normal lives. Experimental Sciences goes beyond the deductive epiphanies of Insight, carrying armloads of tools and foolhardy enthusiasm into the realms of the unproven. It goes beyond the kit-bashing of Mechanic (Jury-rig) and steps right into what mundane folk might call “mad science.”">

    description="Use your History skill to draw on your knowledge of the past to solve current problems. This skill represents your understanding of past events throughout the galaxy. A History check can give you helpful context for the environment in which you find yourself, and can provide the information you need to solve a problem facing the company.

    description="Use your Insight skill to make deductive leaps beyond the scope of player knowledge.

There are hundreds of thousands of disparate family trees of biology in the galaxy, and with training in Xenobiology you can quickly ascertain what it is you’re looking at. A successful Xenobiology check might tell you how to make non-lethal attacks against a creature, how to make it sick, or how sick it will make you if you eat it.
