    isunique="yes"
    description="Dodge represents your self-preservation instinct, and your training that reinforces this instinct. This is your ability to predict incoming violence and get out of the way. The source of danger is irrelevant; whether you’re threatened by a directed attack, a passive trap, the environment, or something else, you always use Dodge to avoid injury.">

    id="skHvyWeap"
    name="Heavy Weapons"
    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Heavy Weapons skill when firing heavy-class weapons. If your weapon hangs underslung, feels massive, rotates, and makes terrifying noises when it’s fired, then you’re packing a heavy weapon. Tanks, large vehicles, power-armored sophonts — these all become valid targets when you fire a heavy weapon.">

    name="Long Gun"
    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Long Guns skill when firing long gun-class weapons. As the weapons of choice for sharpshooters, long guns include high-powered rifles, snipers, and long-range flechette guns.

  <thing

    name="Melee"
    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"

    description="Use your Pistols skill when firing pistol-class weapons. Hold-outs, fast-draw handguns, and other ranged weapons designed to be held in a single hand (or hand-equivalent appendage) are used with this skill. Pistols are more easily concealable than many other weapons, making them an excellent choice for clandestine operations in places too civilized for slinging a carbine over a shoulder (or shoulder-equivalent joint).">

    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Scatterguns skill when firing scattergun-class weapons. If your weapon fires a spread of projectiles (or a spray of highenergy particles), use the Scattergun skill. The form factor of scatterguns is like that of many carbines, but these weapons require a different kind of focus and control. Some scatterguns approach heavy weapon-levels of coverage, but they’re still optimal for close quarters combat.">

    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Stationed Weapons skill when firing stationed weapons. Any weapon that is fixed into a brace, built into a structure, mounted on a swivel, or attached to a vehicle counts as a stationed weapon. You may make any Carbine, Long Gun, Scattergun, or Heavy Weapon into a Stationed Weapon by attaching it to a preinstalled weapons slot that already exists in a vehicle, turret, tripod, or wall. If a pre-installed weapons slot is not available, you may still make your weapon stationed by rolling an Engineering check or Mechanic (Jury-rig) check TN 20. The ability to make weapons stationed is particularly valuable to small sophonts, such as esspererin.">

    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Thrown Weapons skill to hurl an item at a target. This skill applies no matter what you throw. If you lob a grenade, hurl a spear, or toss a caber, this skill determines your capacity to rain brutality down on your foes.

The Economics skill tells you where to shop, when to buy, and when to sell, but it isn’t used to broker transactions or settle on a price. For haggling, use Negotiate.">

    name="Experimental Sciences"
    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="They say “necessity is the mother of invention,” and many who said this actually survived the havoc wrought by their inventions. Some even went on to live normal lives. Experimental Sciences goes beyond the deductive epiphanies of Insight, carrying armloads of tools and foolhardy enthusiasm into the realms of the unproven. It goes beyond the kit-bashing of Mechanic (Jury-rig) and steps right into what mundane folk might call “mad science.”">

A History check can give you helpful context for the environment in which you find yourself, and can provide the information you need to solve a problem facing the company.

This skill represents your character’s ability to contemplate their sophont-appropriate center of being in order to reach an epiphany.

    compset="Skill"
    isunique="yes"
    description="Use your Xenobiology skill to determine information about the physiology of the myriad sophont types and non-intelligent species populating the galaxy in the 31st century. There are hundreds of thousands of disparate family trees of biology in the galaxy, and with training in Xenobiology you can quickly ascertain what it is you’re looking at. A successful Xenobiology check might tell you how to make non-lethal attacks against a creature, how to make it sick, or how sick it will make you if you eat it.
